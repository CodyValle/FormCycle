Ok I went ahead and updated our App Name to be FormCycle. I created a new branch for this and I will merge this with the master. It went ahead and refactored the code to match the renaming, but its probably better to do this now then later in the project. - Merrill 11/19

write stuff you want other people to see in here. i.e. things that would be nice to know, or something we should go check out. Or just general updates about what we have been doing so we all know whats going on. - John 11/19
